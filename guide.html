            <cb_p>
              Dungen is a rogue-like RPG that is written in Javascript and
              playable in the browser. In the game, the player controls one or
              more characters as they adventure down into the depths of the
              dungeon, defeating monsters, increasing their skills and
              collecting a wealth of equipment and treasure.
              Nothing ground-breaking here!<br><br>
              The levels are procedurally generated at runtime, hopefully providing
              something different each time. Progress is saved though, between levels
              so the 'CONTINUE' button should load the team and items from the
              previous session. This requires local storage.
              <br><br>
            <cb_p>
            <cb_h2>Game Play<br></cb_h2>
            <cb_p>
              The purpose of the game is to survive! Each level begins at a
              set of stairs and the party must make their way through the level
              and descend further. Each area comprises of 10 levels - 10 sets of
              steps, with each level becoming more difficult than the last. Each
              area contains different types of enemy and also get tougher.
              <br><br>
              The game is a turn-based which allows each character (including
              enemies) to take their turn in order. During a character's turn, it
              can perform an action as long as it has enough action points (AP),
              if it doesn't have enough AP then the character rests for that turn
              and recovers some AP. At the beginning of their turn, the character
              receives 2 APs. Movements and attacks both use AP with attacks
              using heavier weapons and/or by a less agile character will consume
              more AP.
              <br><br>
              Each character has health points (HP) too and when this value hits
              zero, the character collapses and will not take another turn until
              they have been revived. When a monster dies, the heroes in the team
              gain experience points (XP) which when accumulated allow the characters
              to level-up which increases maximum HP, AP and their attributes.

            <cb_h1>Playable Characters<br></cb_h1>
            <cb_p>
              The player initially gets to choose a character to play as, and
              as the game progresses, more characters will join the team. Each
              character has a class which defines what equipment their can use
              as well as their starting attributes. Once the characters gain
              enough experience, they level-up and the player can choose how
              the character's attributes develop. The attributes are:<br>
              - Strength, which affects how much damage weapons do.<br>
              - Agility, which affects how efficiently characters use weapons
                and can allow characters to dodge blows.<br>
              - Endurance, affects the character's total HP and AP <br>
              - Wisdom, effectiveness of magical spells that the character
                casts - including attacks with staffs.<br>
              - Will, affects the character's total AP increases and also defines
                their resistance to magical attacks and the efficiency of
                magical attacks. <br>
              <br>
            </cb_p>
              <cb_h2>Knight<br></cb_h2>
              <img src="res/img/knight.png" alt="knight" height="64" width="320">
              <cb_p>
                <br>
                The Knight, a chivalrous brute, uses a sword to attack and is equipped
                with a shield, armour and a helmet for defense. The knight is not
                restricted in what defensiveness equipment he can use, which means his
                defense is high, suitable to close range combat with the sword. This
                combat style is matched by his high strength and endurance.
                <br><br>
              </cb_p>
              <cb_h2>Mage<br></cb_h2>
              <img src="res/img/mage.png" alt="mage" height="64" width="320">
              <cb_p>
                <br>
                The Mage is the opposite of the knight. His wisdom is high to enable
                him to perform effective ranged magical attacks with his staff as well
                as resisting incoming spells as well. The mage has low strength and
                can only equip a limited set of defensive clothing, so he will try to
                avoid monsters - running away if needed! However, he can use
                defensive and recovery spells. The Mage will also attempt to heal other
                members of the party.
                <br><br>
              </cb_p>
              <cb_h2>Rogue<br></cb_h2>
              <img src="res/img/rogue.png" alt="rogue" height="64" width="320">
              <cb_p>
                <br>
                The Rogue uses a balance of strength and agility to land deadly blows
                while dodging attacks. He can equip a good selection of armours,
                except for the heavier ones which would impede his movements. The rogue
                uses blades to attack close range and also can use a selection of
                throwing blades to attack from medium range.
                <br><br>
              </cb_p>
              <cb_h2>Archer<br></cb_h2>
              <img src="res/img/archer.png" alt="archer" height="64" width="320">
              <cb_p>
                <br>
                The Archer is a long range combatant who uses a combination of bows
                and arrows to deal high damage from afar. The Archer's key skill is
                agility to enable him to fire arrows in quick succession, but he also
                needs strength to draw his bow. As a ranged character, the Archer will
                try to keep away from melee combatants. Like the Rogue, he can equip a
                good selection of armour and helmets but not the heavier items.

                The Warlock is a physically strong character who wields an axe
                but can also use spells. The warlock has strong will, endurance and
                strength but is not very agile. ALSO NOT AVAILABLE YET.

            <cb_h1>Equipment and Items<br></cb_h1>
            <cb_p>
              Each character has four equipment slots: their primary attack weapon,
              their secondary item, body armour and a helmet. The class of the
              characters defines which item types they can and can't use. As the game
              progresses the player will encounter chests placed throughout the dungeons
              which contain equipment and potions and treasure that will help the team
              survive their adventure.
              <br><br>
              <cb_h2>Weapons<br></cb_h2>
              Weapons have a number of statistics which describe their potential:<br>
              - power, how much damage it can do.<br>
              - range, how close does the enemy have to be to perform an attack.<br>
              - magic type, some weapons can cause magical damage.<br>
              - energy, how much energy it will cost to use it.<br>
              <br>
              <cb_h2>Armour<br></cb_h2>
              Armour comes in three forms: body armour, helmet, and for the Knight, a
              shield. All of these have the same kind of attributes:<br>
              - defense, how much physical damage the item provides.<br>
              - elemental type, the item maybe magical and provide protection from an
              opposing element type.<br>
              <br>
              <cb_h2>Potions<br></cb_h2>
              Potions will be found in chests which help restore HP or AP, or possibly both.
              The effects can be on a single character only or across the team, it depends
              on the potion.<br>
              <br>
              <cb_h2>Treasure<br></cb_h2>
              Ah, the shiny things... maybe will be useful for something at some point.
              Currently, they turn into coins - which you can spend on nothing!<br>
              <br>
              <br>
            </cb_p>
            <cb_h2>Magical Effects<br></cb_h2>
            <cb_p>
            As mentioned above, it is possible for items to be imbued with magical properties.
            Fire, frost, electric and poison items will be found inside chests. A weapon with
            magical properties will often damage the opponent in additional ways:<br>
            - both fire and poison will deal extra damage.<br>
            - the frost effect will drain the opponent's energy.<br>
            - while an electric attack will reduce both health and energy.<br>
            The effects may last multiple turns.<br><br>
            TODO: A magical defensive item should provide a passive effect:<br>
            - protect against other magical attacks.<br>
            - poison armour could poison melee attackers.<br>
            - restore health and energy.<br>
            <br>
            </cb_p>

              Control of the heroes is performed purely through touch or mouse clicks,
              clicking or tapping on targets or items they want to interact with. This
              includes monsters, chests and potential team mates. If an item is
              interactable, an orange target will appear over the target once it has
              been targeted.<br>
              There are also some on-screen buttons that are provided for menus, etc...
              In the bottom right of the screen is the main controller
              button, which looks like a directional controller from an old
              gamepad. On clicking this button, another set of buttons will
              appear above it which enable the player to access menus and take
              team actions.<br>
              - Centre camera on the hero. <br>
              - Open or close equipment menu. <br>
              - Select single or team control <br>
              - Rest, will rest the party until they're fully rested or until another
                command is given.<br>
              - Heal, with quick button will select the weakest potion that the player
                is in possession of to heal the currently controlled hero.<br>

              Clicking on the person button will bring up the menu for hero in the top
              right corner of the screen. The view will show the stats for the hero,
              with their current equipment displayed at the top. Clicking on any of the
              currently equipped items will bring up a list of alternative items that
              the player has in their inventory. Clicking on an item in this list will
              equip it to the hero.
