            <cb_p>
              Dungen is a rogue-like RPG that is written in Javascript and
              playable in the browser. In the game, the player controls one or
              more characters as they adventure down into the depths of the
              dungeon, defeating monsters, increasing their skills and
              collecting a wealth of equipment and treasure.

            <cb_p>
              The player initially gets to choose a character to play as, and
              as the game progresses, more characters will join the team. Each
              character has a class which defines what equipment their can use
              as well as their starting attributes. Once the characters gain
              enough experience, they level-up and the player can choose how
              the character's attributes develop. The attributes are:<br>
              - Strength, which affects how much damage weapons do.<br>
              - Agility, which affects how efficiently characters use weapons
                and can allow characters to dodge blows.<br>
              - Endurance, affects the character's total HP and EP <br>
              - Wisdom, effectiveness of magical spells that the character
                casts - including attacks with staffs.<br>
              - Will, affects the character's total EP increases and also defines
                their resistance to magical attacks. <br>
              <br>

                <br>
                The Knight uses a sword to attack and is equipped with a shield,
                armour and a helmet for defense. The knight is not restricted in
                what defensiveness equipment he can use, which means his defense
                is high, suitable to close range combat with the sword. This
                combat style is matched by his high strength and endurance, as
                well as reasonable agility.

              <cb_p>
                <br>
                The Mage is the opposite of the knight. His wisdom is high to enable
                him to perform effective ranged magical attacks with his staff as well
                as resisting incoming spells as well. The mage has low strength and
                can only equip a limited set of defensive clothing, so he has to rely on
                being agile enough to dodge blows as well as using defensive and
                recovery spells.

                <br>
                The Rogue uses a balance of strength and agility to land deadly blows
                while dodging attacks. He can equip a good selection of armours,
                except for the heavier ones which would impede his movements. The rogue
                uses blades to attack close range and also can use a selection of
                throwing blades to attack from medium range.

                <br>
                The Archer is a long range combantant who uses a combination of bows
                and arrows to deal high damage from afar. The Archer's key skill is
                agility to enable him to fire arrows in quick succession, but he also
                needs strength to draw his bow. Like the Rogue, he can equip a good
                selection of armour and helmets but not the heavier items.

                The Warlock is a physically strong character who wields an axe
                but can also use spells. The warlock has strong will, endurance and
                strength but is not very agile.

            <cb_h2>Turn-based action<br></cb_h2>
            <cb_p>
              Dungen is a turn-based game which allows each character (including
              enemies) to take their turn in order. During a character's turn, it
              can perform an action as long as it has enough energy points (EP),
              if it doesn't have enough EP then the character rests for that turn
              and recovers some EP. Movements and attacks both use EP with attacks
              using heavier weapons and/or by a less agile character will consume
              more EP.
              Each character has health points (HP) too and when this value hits
              zero, the character collapses and will not take another turn until
              they have been revived. When a monster dies, the heroes in the team
              gain experience points (XP) which when accumulated allow the characters
              to level-up which increases maximum HP, EP and their attributes.

            <cb_h2>Equipment and Items<br></cb_h2>
            <cb_p>
              Each character has four equipment slots: their primary attack weapon,
              their secondary item, body armour and a helmet. The class of the
              characters defines which item types they can and can't use. As the game
              progresses the player will encounter chests placed throughout the dungeons
              which contain equipment and potions and treasure that will help the team
              survive their adventure.

              Control of the heroes is performed purely through touch or mouse clicks.
              The player will click or tap on targets or items they want to interact with
              as well as some on-screen buttons that are provided for menus, etc...
              In the bottom right of the screen is the main controller
              button, which looks like a directional controller from an old
              gamepad. On clicking this button, another set of buttons will
              appear above it which enable the player to access menus and take
              team actions.<br>
              - Centre camera on the hero. <br>
              - Open or close equipment menu. <br>
              - Select single or team control <br>
              - Rest, will rest the party until they're fully rested or until another
                command is given.<br>
              - Heal, with quick button will select the weakest potion that the player
                is in possession of to heal the currently controlled hero.<br>

              Clicking on the person button will bring up the menu for hero in the top
              right corner of the screen. The view will show the stats for the hero,
              with their current equipment displayed at the top. Clicking on any of the
              currently equipped items will bring up a list of alternative items that
              the player has in their inventory. Clicking on an item in this list will
              equip it to the hero.
